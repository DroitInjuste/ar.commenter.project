<h4>Typres:
    <h5>The main source for the grip is the four tyres. The strong rubber allows drivers to pass wide corners in a high speed around 180 km/h. There will be three sets of racing tyres in each race, soft, medium and hard.</h5>

<h4>Front Wing: <h5>Front wing is a very important part for teams to adjust their cars. It has four parts, so that teams can adjust the front wing in a short time.</h5> </h4>

<h4>Rear Wing:</h4>
<h5>An important function for rear wing is that the upper part of the wing can "open" to reduce the downforce in straight lines to imporve the speed.</h5>

<h4>Halo:</h4> 
<h5>The best design ever! It saves drivers' lives since the cockpit is open, it is the only and the most important protection.</h5>

<h5> It makes the car to get over the high G when turing at high speed cornors. The suspension is very firm.</h5>
