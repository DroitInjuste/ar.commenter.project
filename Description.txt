    <p style="font-size: 10px">The diffuser and the body are intergral, making the floor aas the main source for gaining downforce, and it causes less dirty air than previrous cars.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 10px">The main source for the grip is the four tyres. The strong rubber allows drivers to pass wide corners in a high speed around 180 km/h. There will be three sets of racing tyres in each race, soft, medium and hard.</p>

Front Wing: Front wing is a very important part for teams to adjust their cars. It has four parts, so that teams can adjust the front wing in a short time.

Rear Wing: An important function for rear wing is that the upper part of the wing can "open" to reduce the downforce in straight lines to imporve the speed.

Halo: The best design ever! It saves drivers' lives since the cockpit is open, it is the only and the most important protection.

Suspension: to get over the high G when turing at high speed cornors. The suspension is very firm.
